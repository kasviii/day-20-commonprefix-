# Longest Common Prefix Finder

This Python script finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings.

## Usage

Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]

Output: "fl"

Explanation: Among the strings "flower", "flow", and "flight," the longest common prefix is "fl."



If the input were ["dog", "racecar", "car"]:

Output: " “

Explanation: There is no common prefix among the strings "dog", "racecar," and "car," so the output is an empty string (“ “)


## Note

- If there is no common prefix among the strings, the script will output an empty string.
- The script assumes that the user provides valid input.
